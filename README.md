# Grievance ChatBot

Welcome to the Grievance ChatBot GitHub repository! This ChatBot is designed to provide support and answers related to CPGRAMS (Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System).

## Introduction

The Grievance ChatBot leverages advanced technologies such as streamlit, torch, langchain, and more to offer an interactive and intelligent conversational experience. It utilizes a combination of language models, embeddings, and vector stores to understand and respond to user queries.

- torch
- langchain
- streamlit_chat
- Pillow
- better_profanity

## Features

### 1. Intelligent Conversations
The ChatBot engages in intelligent conversations, providing relevant and context-aware responses to user queries.

### 2. Offensive Language Detection
Utilizes the `better_profanity` library to detect and handle offensive language, ensuring a respectful and safe interaction environment.

### 3. GPU/CPU Compatibility
Checks for GPU availability using PyTorch, allowing seamless execution on GPU if available, or falling back to CPU.

### 4. Streamlit Interface
Employs the Streamlit framework to create a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the ChatBot.

### 5. Conversation History
Maintains a conversation history that is displayed using Streamlit messages, providing users with a contextual view of the ongoing conversation.
